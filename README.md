# OrbitNotify-International-Space-Station-tracker-
This project is a Python-based automation tool that tracks the real-time location of the International Space Station (ISS) and sends an email alert when it's passing near the user's location. It uses the Open Notify API to fetch the ISS's current coordinates and compares them with predefined latitude and longitude values. If the ISS is within a 5-degree radius, the script triggers an email notification using Gmail's SMTP server. The email includes a friendly message encouraging the user to look up and spot the station in the sky. The script runs continuously, checking every 60 seconds, and ensures secure email delivery using an app-specific password.
